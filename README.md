1. I would not use a unit test to test for a message because it focuses on individual components, not the interactions between two things
2. Yes, I would use a unit test to test for the max length feature because the feature is specific and can be easily tested in isolation. The unit test is ideal because it can handle cases both before the limit and beyond the limit to see which produces an error.
